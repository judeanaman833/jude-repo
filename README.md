**Use Python Basics for a Data Application in your Company **

This project is to focus on a breastfeeding and formula feeding infants over the years. 
Final output should be a table that splits the calendar years into 4 quarters, with Q1 being Jan - March, Q2 being Apr - June, Q3 being July - Sept, and Q4 being Oct - Dec.
Calculate the total number of infant participants from the Total Infants tables, Sum all of the breastfeeding infants, and sum all of the formula infants. 
Should be 16 or so columns, like so Q1_2013_BreastFeeding, Q1_2013_Formula, Q1_2013_Total...and so forth until you end with Q4_2016_Total
Should have rows for each state/territory in the data, You should only need 3 tables from each year to accomplish this.
***NOTE: The tables start in October and end in September of the following year so your first column will actually begin with Q4_2012 and your last will begin with Q3_2016
